I just created a small game that is played on phone, computer or any device, touchscreen or not.<br>
Remember that game that made you spend so much time away from listening in class ? Now you can play just whenever, wherever, by dropping in on you home server, changing the IP the socket connects on and run it using "node app.js" and connecting to it using [xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx]:8080 (Server listening on port 8080).<br>

You're all set ! Have fun

I update the game often.
